# Thesis
This repository contains the scripts I created as part of my thesis to run a di-muon analysis by Gesier et al. 
These scripts may be useful to students who wish to automate the analysis and create di-muon mass spectra. 

There were other pieces of code used for this thesis project, but they were originally authored by other researchers 
and may be found on those individuals GitHub repositories. Since I did not create these tools, I won't be hosting them here.
